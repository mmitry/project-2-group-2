# project-2-group-6

With this group project we were provided data for crowdfunding sources and contacts. The goal was to clean up the data in order to design a new database. Through the database we can then analyze the data to determine what is the most popular crowdfunding category, what are the outcomes based on goal, which country had the most successful campaigns, How many successful campaigns were there in each subcategory, and which subcategory has the highest number of successful campaigns.

Layout of the Repo:

- mmitry: contains Monica's sandbox for codes.
- S_Schahnawaz: contains Shahla's sandboc for codes.
